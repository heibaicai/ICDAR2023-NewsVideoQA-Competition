of the impacts of the temperature you've found, which is that estimates of the impacts of the temperature rise of three degrees celsius are actually underrepresented compared to their likelihood. could you unpack that finding for us? indeed, so this is based upon two text mining reports of the ipcc report. so basically we looked at the number of mentions of different temperature rise scenarios and we compared these, looked at the number of mentions of different temperature rise scenarios. and we compared these to two different plausible warming scenarios in the future, 550 and 700 parts per

the impacts of the temperature rise of three degrees celsius are actually underrepresented compared to their likelihood. could you unpack that finding for us? indeed, so this is based upon two text mining reports of the ipcc report. so basically we looked at the number of mentions of different temperature rise scenarios and we compared these to two different plausible warming scenarios in the

two degrees were overrepresented. this is most likely due to the goals of the paris agreement, which focused upon 1.5 and two degrees and limiting to those temperatures. it's also likely because it's
